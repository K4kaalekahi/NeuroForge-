# NeuroForge Application

## Description
The NeuroForge application is designed to leverage advanced algorithms to facilitate enriched neural network research and experimentation. It serves as a platform for researchers and developers to create, modify, and deploy neural network models efficiently.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Utilizes a modular design allowing for easy integration of new algorithms and functionality.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with the application.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large datasets and complex neural network configurations without performance degradation.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Offers tools for visualizing data and model performance in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs seamlessly on various operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Architecture
The application is structured around a core engine that manages the neural network models. Components are divided into various modules:
- **Data Processing Module**: Handles data input, cleansing, and pre-processing for models.
- **Training Module**: Facilitates the training of neural networks with adjustable parameters and hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation Module**: Provides metrics for evaluating the performance of trained models.
- **Visualization Module**: Delivers graphical representations of model training, validation, and test data performance.

## How to Run
